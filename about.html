                <p>The firm is a strong advocate for its clients and seeks to be Sierra Leone’s premier law firm. The varied and combined experiences of the members of the firm make the firm a solid provider of legal services and the right choice to provide specialist legal support in transactions involving government ministries, agencies and departments, international institutions as well as guiding investors and entrepreneurs through the process of setting up and registering a company in Sierra Leone as well as obtaining all the necessary clearances and permits that will enable a business to run effectively. Additionally, the firm’s strong negotiating credentials are very useful in guiding through mergers and acquisitions, debt collection and obtaining favorable terms from the Government of Sierra Leone for concessions such as duty-free waivers and others in appropriate circumstances.</p>
                            <p>The firm has substantial experience in litigating all kinds of civil matters within the Superior Courts of Judicature of Sierra Leone. We constantly deal with transactional/business/commercial law issues and provide advisory and transaction specific advice on legal matters including providing legal review and advice on all variety of legal documents; providing country-specific policy and regulatory analysis and advice; conduct local due diligence on third parties; providing specific local law advice on agreements. </p>
                            <p>Members of the firm have been engaged by the Millennium Challenge Coordinating Unit (MCCU) an autonomous entity with independent legal authority to oversee, manage, and implement a Threshold Program(THP) funded by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) to provide a host of consultancy services. MCC is a U.S. government agency focused on assisting countries dedicated to good governance, economic freedom, and investments in people.  The MCC Threshold Program with Sierra Leone provides up to $44.4 million to support significant policy reforms and improve governance in the water and electricity sectors. By establishing independent regulation, strengthening key institutions, and increasing transparency and accountability, the program has created a foundation for the financially sustainable provision of essential water and electricity services, as well as limit opportunities for corruption in service delivery.  Members of our firm have been engaged to provide regulatory support services and program closure services to the MCCU threshold program as individual legal consultants.</p>
                            <p>S&B has a dynamic debt recovery practice and collects debts for commercial banks as well as companies (both foreign and local) and individuals using both a soft approach i.e. negotiating repayment terms and settling matters out of court where possible and a hard approach – litigation where it appears to be the most effective option. S&B continues to successfully recover significant sums of money for our clients including a $19 million judgment against one of the largest mining companies in Sierra Leone</p>

                            <p>S&B has experience advising and document preparation on Public Private Partnership projects and was part of a team that provided procurement legal advisory services to the Government of Sierra Leone for the implementation of the second phase of the Bumbuna Hydro Project; a USD$400,000,000 (Four Hundred Million United States Dollars) project. We have worked on several Power Purchase Agreements (“PPA”) including the PPA between the main electricity generation and distribution companies and a PPA with the Government of Sierra Leone (“GoSL”) on behalf of a client engaged in the renewable energy sector to provide solar energy to the cities of Bo and Kenema, Sierra Leone’s second and third largest cities with a combined population of approximately 450,000 as well as to two constituent colleges of the University of Sierra Leone. We have also worked with a Middle Eastern company that has negotiated the sale of thermal plants to the Government of Sierra Leone for installation in several districts around the country. We have routinely provided consultancy services for electricity and energy projects. The firm also has a successful successions and estates law practice where it deals with obtaining letters of administration as well as probate and litigating contentious succession/probate matters. Similarly, the firm has significant experience in family law matters ranging from divorce to adoption. </p>

                            <p>S&B is very attentive to deadlines. The firm serves as company secretary to some of its clients and currently maintains strong links with other law firms across the African continent particularly the West African sub region and with firms outside of Africa.  
                            Languages spoken at the firm fluently are English and French with a working knowledge of Mandarin.</p>
